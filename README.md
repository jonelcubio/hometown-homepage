# 🏙️ Hometown Homepage — React Project

This project is based on a Scrimba HTML & CSS course assignment, where the task was to build a "Hometown Homepage."  
Instead of using plain HTML/CSS, I chose to recreate the project using **React**.

## 🌏 About the Project

The goal of the assignment was to build a simple homepage highlighting a specific place.  
For my version, I chose **Seoul, South Korea** — a city I haven’t visited yet but would love to explore one day!

This React project includes:

- ⭐ A landing/hero image showcasing Seoul  
- 📝 A short introduction to the city  
- 🎯 A “Things to Do” section with attractions and activities  
- 👤 A fun, fictional profile to add a personal touch
